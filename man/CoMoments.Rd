CoKurtosis(Ra, Rb)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ra}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{Rb}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
index, benchmark, portfolio, or secondary asset returns to compare against}

\description{
calculates coskewness and cokurtosis as the skewness and kurtosis of two
assets with reference to one another.
}
\details{
Ranaldo and Favre (2005) define coskewness and cokurtosis as the skewness
and kurtosis of a given asset analysed with the skewness and kurtosis of the
reference asset or portfolio.  Adding an asset to a portfolio, such as a
hedge fund with a significant level of coskewness to the portfolio, can
increase or decrease the resulting portfolio's skewness. Similarly, adding a
hedge fund with a positive cokurtosis coefficient will add kurtosis to the
portfolio.

The co-moments are useful for measuring the marginal contribution of each
asset to the portfolio's resulting risk.  As such, comoments of asset return
distribution should be useful as inputs for portfolio optimization in
addition to the covariance matrix.  Martellini and Ziemann (2007) point out
that the problem of portfolio selection becomes one of selecting tangency
points in four dimensions, incorporating expected return, second, third and
fourth centered moments of asset returns.

Even outside of the optimization problem, measuring the co-moments should be
a useful tool for evaluating whether or not an asset is likely to provide
diversification potential to a portfolio, not only in terms of normal risk
(i.e. volatility) but also the risk of assymetry (skewness) and extreme
events (kurtosis).
