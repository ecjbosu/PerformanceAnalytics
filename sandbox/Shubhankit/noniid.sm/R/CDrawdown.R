#' @title Chekhlov Conditional Drawdown at Risk
#' 
#' @description  A new one-parameter family of risk measures called Conditional Drawdown (CDD) has
#'been proposed. These measures of risk are functionals of the portfolio drawdown (underwater) curve considered in active portfolio management. For some value of the tolerance
#' parameter, in the case of a single sample path, drawdown functional is defineed as
#'the mean of the worst (1 - \eqn{\alpha})% drawdowns. 
#'@details 
#'The \bold{CDD} is related to Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk
#'(CVaR) measures studied by Rockafellar and Uryasev . By definition, with
#'respect to a specified  probability level \eqn{\alpha}, the \bold{\eqn{\alpha}-VaR} of a portfolio is the lowest
#'amount \eqn{\epsilon}
#', \eqn{\alpha} such that, with probability \eqn{\alpha}, the loss will not exceed \eqn{\epsilon}
#', \eqn{\alpha} in a specified
#'time T, whereas the \bold{\eqn{\alpha}-CVaR} is the conditional expectation of losses above that
#'amount \eqn{\epsilon}
#'. Various issues about VaR methodology were discussed by Jorion .
#'The CDD is similar to CVaR and can be viewed as a modification of the CVaR
#'to the case when the loss-function is defined as a drawdown. CDD and CVaR are
#'conceptually related percentile-based risk performance functionals.
