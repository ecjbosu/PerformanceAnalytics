#'@title OW Return Model
#'@description The objective is to determine the true underlying return by removing the 
#' autocorrelation structure in the original return series without making any assumptions 
#' regarding the actual time series properties of the underlying process. We are 
#' implicitly assuming by this approach that the autocorrelations that arise in reported 
#'returns are entirely due to the smoothing behavior funds engage in when reporting 
#' results. In fact, the method may be adopted to produce any desired 
#' level of autocorrelation at any lag and is not limited to simply eliminating all 
#'autocorrelations.It can be be said as the general form of Geltner Return Model
#'@details 
#'Given a sample of historical returns \eqn{R(1),R(2), . . .,R(T)},the method assumes the fund manager smooths returns in the following manner:
#' \deqn{ r(0,t)  =  \sum \beta (i) r(0,t-i) + (1- \alpha)r(m,t) }
#' Where :\deqn{  \sum \beta (i) = (1- \alpha) }
#' \bold{r(0,t)} : is the observed (reported) return at time t (with 0 adjustments to reported returns), 
#'\bold{r(m,t)} : is the true underlying (unreported) return at time t (determined by making m adjustments to reported returns).
#'
#'To remove the \bold{first m orders} of autocorrelation from a given return series we would proceed in a manner very similar to that detailed in \bold{ \code{\link{Return.Geltner}} \cr}. We would initially remove the first order autocorrelation, then proceed to eliminate the second order autocorrelation through the iteration process. In general, to remove any order, m, autocorrelations from a given return series we would make the following transformation to returns:
#' autocorrelation structure in the original return series without making any assumptions regarding the actual time series properties of the underlying process. We are implicitly assuming by this approach that the autocorrelations that arise in reported returns are entirely due to the smoothing behavior funds engage in when reporting results. In fact, the method may be adopted to produce any desired level of autocorrelation at any lag and is not limited to simply eliminating all autocorrelations.
