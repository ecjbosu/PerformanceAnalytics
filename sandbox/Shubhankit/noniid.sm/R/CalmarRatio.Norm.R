#' @title Normalized Calmar ratio
#'  
#' @description Normalized Calmar and Sterling Ratios are yet another method of creating a
#' risk-adjusted measure for ranking investments similar to the Sharpe Ratio.
#' 
#' @details 
#' Both the Normalized Calmar and the Sterling ratio are the ratio of annualized return
#' over the absolute value of the maximum drawdown of an investment.
#' \deqn{Sterling Ratio  =   [Return over (0,T)]/[max Drawdown(0,T)]}
#' It is also \emph{traditional} to use a three year return series for these
#' calculations, although the functions included here make no effort to
#' determine the length of your series.  If you want to use a subset of your
#' series, you'll need to truncate or subset the input data to the desired
#' length.

  # DESCRIPTION:
  # Inputs:
  # Ra: in this case, the function anticipates having a return stream as input,
  #    rather than prices.
  # tau : scaled Time in Years
  # scale: number of periods per year
  # Outputs:
  # This function returns a Calmar Ratio
  
  # FUNCTION:
