#'@title Sharpe Ratio Statistics Summary 
#'@description
#' The Sharpe ratio is simply the return per unit of risk (represented by
#' variability).  In the classic case, the unit of risk is the standard
#' deviation of the returns.
#' 
#' \deqn{\frac{\overline{(R_{a}-R_{f})}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{(R_{a}-R_{f})}}}}
#' 
#' William Sharpe now recommends \code{\link{InformationRatio}} preferentially
#' to the original Sharpe Ratio.
#' 
#' The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the combined performance of "risk"
#' and return.
#' 
#' As noted, the traditional Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure of return
#' that uses standard deviation to represent risk.

#' Although the Sharpe ratio has become part of the canon of modern financial 
#' analysis, its applications typically do not account for the fact that it is an
#' estimated quantity, subject to estimation errors that can be substantial in 
#' some cases.
#' 
#' Many studies have documented various violations of the assumption of 
#' IID returns for financial securities.
#' 
#' Under the assumption of stationarity,a version of the Central Limit Theorem can 
#' still be  applied to the estimator .
#' @details
#' The relationship between SR and SR(q) is somewhat more involved for non-
#'IID returns because the variance of Rt(q) is not just the sum of the variances of component returns but also includes all the covariances. Specifically, under
#' the assumption that returns \eqn{R_t}  are stationary,
#' \deqn{ Var[(R_t)] =   \sum \sum Cov(R(t-i),R(t-j)) = q{\sigma^2} + 2{\sigma^2} \sum (q-k)\rho(k) }
#' Where  \eqn{ \rho(k) = Cov(R(t),R(t-k))/Var[(R_t)]} is the \eqn{k^{th}} order autocorrelation coefficient of the series of returns.This yields the following relationship between SR and SR(q):
#' and i,j belongs to 0 to q-1
#'\deqn{SR(q)  =  \eta(q) }
#'Where :
#' \deqn{ }{\eta(q) = [q]/[\sqrt(q\sigma^2) + 2\sigma^2 \sum(q-k)\rho(k)] }
#' Where, k belongs to 0 to q-1
#' SR(q) :  Estimated Lo Sharpe Ratio
