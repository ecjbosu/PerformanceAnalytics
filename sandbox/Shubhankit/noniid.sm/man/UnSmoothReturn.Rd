\arguments{

\description{
  Creates a table of estimates of moving averages for
  comparison across multiple instruments or funds as well
  as their standard error and smoothing index , which is
  Compenent Decomposition of Table of Unsmooth Returns
}
\details{
  The estimation method is based on a maximum likelihood
  estimation of a moving average process (we use the
  innovations algorithm proposed by \bold{Brockwell and
  Davis} [1991]). The first step of this approach consists
  in computing a series of de-meaned observed returns:
  \deqn{X(t) = R(0,t)- \mu} where \eqn{\mu} is the expected
  value of the series of observed returns. As a
  consequence, the above equation can be written as :
  \deqn{X(t)= \theta(0)\eta(t) + \theta(1)\eta(t-1) + .....
  + \theta(k)\eta(t-k)} with the additional assumption that
  : \bold{\eqn{\eta(k)= N(0,\sigma(\eta)^2)}} The structure
  of the model and the two constraints suppose that the
  complete integration of information in the price of the
  considered asset may take up to k periods because of its
  illiquidity. In addition, according to Getmansky et al.,
  this model is in line with previous models of
  nonsynchronous trading such as the one developed by
  \bold{Cohen, Maier, Schwartz and Whitcomb} [1986].
  Smoothing has an impact on the third and fourth moments
  of the returns distribution too.
