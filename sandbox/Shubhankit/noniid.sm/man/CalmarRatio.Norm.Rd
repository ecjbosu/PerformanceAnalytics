\usage{
  CalmarRatio.Norm(R, tau = 1, scale = NA)
}
\arguments{
  \item{R}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries
  or zoo object of asset returns}

  \item{scale}{number of periods in a year (daily scale =
  252, monthly scale = 12, quarterly scale = 4)}

  \item{tau}{for Sterling Ratio, excess amount to add to
  the max drawdown, traditionally and default .1 (10\%)}
}
\description{
  Normalized Calmar and Sterling Ratios are yet another
  method of creating a risk-adjusted measure for ranking
  investments similar to the Sharpe Ratio.
}
\details{
  Both the Normalized Calmar and the Sterling ratio are the
  ratio of annualized return over the absolute value of the
  maximum drawdown of an investment. \deqn{Sterling Ratio =
  [Return over (0,T)]/[max Drawdown(0,T)]} It is also
  \emph{traditional} to use a three year return series for
  these calculations, although the functions included here
  make no effort to determine the length of your series.
  If you want to use a subset of your series, you'll need
  to truncate or subset the input data to the desired
  length. It is also traditional to use a three year return
