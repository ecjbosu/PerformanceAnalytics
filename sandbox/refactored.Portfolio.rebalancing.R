#' Calculate weighted returns for a portfolio of assets
#'
#' Using a time series of returns and any regular or irregular time series of weights
#' for each asset, this function calculates the returns of a portfolio with the same 
#' periodicity of the returns data.  
#'
#' By default, this function calculates the time series of portfolio returns given asset
#' returns and weights. In verbose mode, the function returns a list of intermediary 
#' calculations that users may find helpful, including both asset contribution and  
#' asset value through time.
#' 
#' When asset return and weights are matched by period, contribution is simply the 
#' weighted return of the asset.  c_i = w_i * R_i Contributions are summable across the 
#' portfolio to calculate the total portfolio return.
#' 
#' Contribution cannot be aggregated through time.  For example, say we have an equal 
#' weighted portfolio of five assets with monthly returns.  The geometric return of the 
#' portfolio over several months won't match any aggregation of the individual 
#' contributions of the assets, particularly if any rebalancing was done during the 
#' period.
#' 
#' To aggregate contributions through time such that they are summable to the geometric 
#' returns of the portfolio, the calculation must track changes in the notional value of 
#' the assets and portfolio.  For example, contribution during a quarter will be 
#' calculated as the change in value of the position through those three months, divided 
#' by the original value of the portfolio.  Approaching it this way makes the 
#' calculation robust to weight changes as well. c_pi = V_(t-p)i - V_t)/V_ti  
#' 
#' If the user does not specify weights, an equal weight portfolio is assumed.  
#' Alternatively, a vector or single-row matrix of weights that matches the length 
#' of the asset columns may be specified.  In either case, if no rebalancing period is
#' specified, the weights will be applied at the beginning of the asset time series
#' and no further rebalancing will take place. If a rebalancing period is specified, 
#' the portfolio will be rebalanced to the starting weights at the interval specified.  
#' 
#' Return.rebalancing will work only on daily or lower frequencies. If you are 
#' rebalancing intraday, you should be using a trades/prices framework like 
#' {\link{\code{blotter}}}, not a weights/returns framework.
#' 
#' Irregular rebalancing can be done by specifying a time series of weights.  The 
#' function uses the date index of the weights for xts-style subsetting of rebalancing 
#' periods.
#' 
#' Weights specified for rebalancing should be thought of as "end-of-period" weights. 
#' Rebalancing periods can be thought of as taking effect immediately after the close 
#' of the bar. So, a March 31 rebalancing date will actually be in effect for April 1. 
#' A December 31 rebalancing date will be in effect on Jan 1, and so forth. This 
#' convention was chosen because it fits with common usage, and because it simplifies 
#' xts Date subsetting via endpoints.
#'
#' In verbose mode, the function returns a list of data and intermediary calculations.
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{\code{returns}:}{ The portfolio returns.}
#'   \item{\code{contribution}:}{ The per period contribution to portfolio 
#'   return of each asset. Contribution is calculated as BOP weight times the 
#'   period's return divided by BOP value. Period contributions are summed 
#'   across the individual assets to calculate portfolio return}
#'   \item{\code{BOP.Weight}:}{ Beginning of Period (BOP) Weight for each 
#'   asset. An asset's BOP weight is calculated using the input weights 
#'   (or assumed weights, see below) and rebalancing parameters given. The next 
#'   period's BOP weight is either the EOP weights from the prior period or 
#'   input weights given on a rebalance period.}
#'   \item{\code{EOP.Weight:}}{ End of Period (BOP) Weight for each asset. 
#'   An asset's EOP weight is the sum of the asset's BOP weight and 
#'   contribution for the period divided by the sum of the contributions and 
#'   initial weights for the portfolio.}
#'   \item{\code{BOP.Value:}}{ BOP Value for each asset. The BOP value for each 
#'   asset is the asset's EOP value from the prior period, unless there is a 
#'   rebalance event.  If there is a rebalance event, the BOP value of the 
#'   asset is the rebalance weight times the EOP value of the portfolio. That 
#'   effectively provides a zero-transaction cost change to the position values 
#'   as of that date to reflect the rebalance.  Note that the sum of the BOP 
#'   values of the assets is the same as the prior period's EOP portfolio value.}
#'   \item{\code{EOP.Value:}}{ EOP Value for each asset. The EOP value is for 
#'   each asset is calculated as (1 + asset return) times the asset's BOP value. 
#'   The EOP portfolio value is the sum of EOP value across assets.}
#' }
#' 
#' To calculate BOP and EOP position value, we create an index for each position.  The 
#' sum of that value across assets represents an indexed value of the total portfolio.  
#' The change in value contained in slot seven is the asset's period return times its 
#' BOP value. 
#' 
#' From the value calculations, we can calculate different aggregations through time 
#' for the asset contributions.  Those are calculated as the EOP asset value less the 
#' BOP asset value; that quantity is divided by the BOP portfolio value.  
#' Across assets, those will sum to equal the geometric chained returns of the 
#' portfolio for that same time period.  The function does not do this directly, however.
